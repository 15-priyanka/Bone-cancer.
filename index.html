<h1 class="first" style="font-variant: uppercase;">Bone cancer</h1>
<h3><marquee> When cancer cells grow in a bone, it can harm normal bone tissue. The type of cell and tissue where cancer begins determines the type of bone cancer.</marquee></h3>

<h3 class="third"> SYMPTOMS:</h3>
<p>Some people with bone cancer have no symptoms other than feeling a painless lump. For others, a variety of symptoms can develop. These symptoms may also occur because of other conditions, such as arthritis or Lyme disease, which may delay the diagnosis. The most common signs of bone cancer include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pain (usually worse at night).</li><li>
Unexplained swelling.</li><li>
Difficulty moving around.</li><li>
Feeling extra tired (fatigue).</li><li>
Fever.</li></ul>


<h3 class="third">CAUSES</h3>
<p>Experts are not certain what causes bone cancer, but they have found links between bone cancer and other factors. The most important factor is being exposed to radiation or drugs during treatment for other cancers. Some bone cancers occur due to conditions that are passed down in families (hereditary), although this is not usually the case.</p>

<h3 class="third">DIAGNOSIS</h3>
<p>To diagnose bone cancer, your healthcare provider will often first use X-rays to view images of your bones. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT (computed tomography) scans provide more detailed images of the areas around the bones and are usually obtained before any treatment.</p><p>

To confirm the diagnosis, your healthcare provider will perform a biopsy, where a small piece of tissue is removed from the bone to be examined under a microscope. A biopsy provides specific information about the cancer, including where it formed. Having this information helps providers know which course of treatment will work best for the specific cancer.</p>


<h3 class="third">TREATMENT</h3>
<p>Bone cancer treatment depends on the type of cancer, whether it has spread and if so, where. People with bone cancer often work with a team of healthcare providers to treat the condition. This group includes doctors who specialize in cancer (oncologists and radiation oncologists) and doctors who specialize in bones and joints (orthopaedic surgeons).
</p><p>
Bone cancer treatment typically involves a combination of approaches. The type and duration of these treatments vary depending on several factors, including the type of bone cancer, the size of the tumor and whether it has spread to other parts of the body. The treatments most commonly used include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Surgery: Your surgeon removes the tumor and some healthy tissue around it. They can also repair or rebuild affected bones with real or artificial bone grafts. Sometimes, an entire limb must be removed to treat cancer. In this case, an artificial limb (prosthetic) can be used. Sometimes repeat surgery is needed if all of the cancer cells were not removed the first time around.</li><li>
Radiation therapy: This treatment shrinks the tumors with high doses of X-rays. Healthcare providers often use radiation before surgery to shrink the tumor so less tissue has to be removed.</li><li>
Chemotherapy: This type of treatment kills cancer cells throughout the body with medicine. People usually receive this medicine by swallowing a pill or having it injected into a vein. Your provider can use chemotherapy to treat primary bone cancers or bone cancers that have spread.<
